                <p class="about_text">Back in 2016, our founders James and Jack, set out to solve a very real problem; being landed with a big, unexpected car repair bill. Today we're a team of over 70 colleagues, spread across several different countries, all working towards the same goal. We help drivers stay on the road, without breaking the bank. As a multi-award-winning digital payments platform for the automotive industry, we partner with over 4,000 automotive retailers helping drivers pay for motoring costs, accessories and other services through a variety of different payment options. In January 2022, we completed our Series A funding round and established ourselves as a rapidly scaling start-up in the fast-growing Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) market which is worth over $90 billion in Europe alone.</p>
